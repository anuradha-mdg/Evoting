        <h5>System of Election</h5>
          <p align="justify">Elections to the Lok Sabha are carried out using a first-past-the-post electoral system. The country is split up into separate 
            geographical areas, known as constituencies, and the electors can cast one vote each for a candidate (although most candidates 
            stand as independents, most successful candidates stand as members of political parties), the winner being the candidate who 
            gets the maximum votes. </p>
          
          <h5>Parliament</h5>
          <p align="justify">The Parliament of the Union consists of the President, the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of
            States). The President is the head of state, and he appoints the Prime Minister, who runs the government, according to the 
            political composition of the Lok Sabha. Although the government is headed by a Prime Minister, the Cabinet is the central 
            decision making body of the government. Members of more than one party can make up a government, and although the governing 
            parties may be a minority in the Lok Sabha, they can only govern as long as they have the confidence of a majority of MPs, the 
            members of the Lok Sabha. As well as being the body, which determines whom, makes up the government, the Lok Sabha is the main 
            legislative body, along with the Rajya Sabha. </p>
          <h5>Rajya Sabha - The Council of States</h5>
          <p align="justify">The members of the Rajya Sabha are elected indirectly, rather than by the citizens at large. Rajya Sabha members are elected 
            by each state Vidhan Sabha using the single transferable vote system. Unlike most federal systems, the number of members returned
            by each state is roughly in proportion to their population. At present there are 233 members of the Rajya Sabha elected by the 
            Vidhan Sabhas, and there are also twelve members nominated by the President as representatives of literature, science, art and 
            social services. Rajya Sabha members can serve for six years, and elections are staggered, with one third of the assembly being 
            elected every 2 years. </p>
          <h5>Nominated members</h5>
          <p align="justify">The president can nominate 2 members of the Lok Sabha if it is felt that the representation of the Anglo-Indian community is 
            inadequate, and 12 members of the Rajya Sabha, to represent literature, science, art and the social services. </p>
          
          <h5>State Assemblies</h5>
          <p align="justify"> India is a federal country, and the Constitution gives the states and union territories significant control over their own 
            government. The Vidhan Sabhas (legislative assemblies) are directly elected bodies set up to carrying out the administration of 
            the government in the 28 States of India. In some states there is a bicameral organisation of legislatures, with both an upper 
            and Lower House. Two of the seven Union Territories viz., the National Capital Territory of Delhi and Pondicherry, have also 
            legislative assemblies. </p>
          <p align="justify"> Elections to the Vidhan Sabhas are carried out in the same manner as for the Lok Sabha election, with the states and union 
            territories divided into single-member constituencies, and the first-past-the-post electoral system used. The assemblies range 
            in size, according to population. The largest Vidhan Sabha is for Uttar Pradesh, with 403 members; the smallest Pondicherry, 
            with 30 members. </p>
         
          <h5>President and Vice-President</h5>
          <p align="justify"> The President is elected by the elected members of the Vidhan Sabhas, Lok Sabha, and Rajya Sabha, and serves for a period of 5 
            years (although they can stand for re-election). A formula is used to allocate votes so there is a balance between the 
            population of each state and the number of votes assembly members from a state can cast, and to give an equal balance between 
            State Assembly members and National Parliament members. If no candidate receives a majority of votes there is a system by which losing 
            candidates are eliminated from the contest and votes for them transferred to other candidates, until one gain a majority. The 
            Vice President is elected by a direct vote of all members elected and nominated, of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. </p>
